Hope Counselling
======
A site to allow clients to book counselling through an online portal

Note: The project is unfinished. I did not complete the project in the time allotted, so am submitting what I have, in the hope that I can complete the project on second submission when it does not pass. 

I would appreciate it if I can be judged by what is currently in the site, to give feedback that I can use going forward. 

Many thanks.
